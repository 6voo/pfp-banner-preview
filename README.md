# Profile and Banner Preview

This simple web application allows you to preview and match your profile picture (pfp) and banner precisely. 
It provides a convenient way to visualize how your profile elements will look together.

## Features

- Choose a profile picture and banner.
- Preview the selected images side by side.
- Customize the layout to match any site's format.

## How I Made It

This project was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The styling was designed to resemble the layout of YouTube and other sites such as Discord, etc. allowing users to easily visualize their profile elements in a similar format.

## Why I Made It
I made it because it was frustrating having to change your banner, wait for it to upload on the site, update, just for it to not match that good...
Personally, I feel like the pfp and banner have to match otherwise I'll look for something new. I can't stand it not matching, even if its just by a bit.
There weren't any other sites I found that allowed you to preview your profile picture and banner, I had to use Figma (an image editing program) just to try to see if it matched... LOL!
